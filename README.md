# Skills Worth Sharing
> For undergraduate & pre-employment level learners.    

All the basics that you need to know for Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering learners.    
These basics are **primarily the things that they don't teach you in universities**, but the majority of them are 
important and you are most likely going to run into them in your graduate studies or your future career.
